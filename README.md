### tensor

- Vector : samples, features => 2D tensor
- Time Series, Sequence Data : samples, timesteps, features => 3D tensor
- Image : (samples, height, width, channels) or (samples, channels, height, width) => 4D tensor
- Video : (samples, frames, height, width, channels) or (samples, frames, channels, height, width) => 5D tensor
